The file "run_analysis.R" tidies and cleans the dataset "UCI HAR Dataset" as part of the assignment "getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project"

This code will carry out the following steps:
         1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
         2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
         3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
         4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
	 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 
Read training data
	x_train -> training data x
	y_train -> training data y
	sub_train -> training data subject

Read test data
	x_test -> test data x
	y_test -> test data y
	sub_test -> test data subject

Read activity label and feature data
	act_labels -> data of activity labels
	features -> data of features

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set (3.)
Use labels to name the subject data
Assign feature name to columns of x data
Assign activity number as label of y data

Create matrices for training and test data
	mat_train ->  matrix with training data
	mat_test -> matrix with test data

Combine training and test data as a matrix
	mat_comb -> matrix with training and test data

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set (1.)
	dataset1 -> merged data by activity number

Sort the merged dataset by subject and adjust row order


Use dplyr library
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement (2.)
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names --> this was mainly performed after step 3 (line 31) (4.)
	dataset1_sub1 -> extractation of all columns of dataset1 with names containing "mean" or "std"
	dataset2 -> combination of the first three columns of dataset1 and dataset1_sub1

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. (5.)
Get column names of dataset2 with only mean and std rows
	c_names -> column names of dataset2

Split the dataset by subject and activity name 
	dataset2_split -> splitted dataset2 by subject and activity name

Function to calculate the column mean while retaining the first three columns (subject, activity name, activity number)
	columnmean -> function for calculating rowmeans while keeping the first 3 columns
	r1 -> temp variable for storing first row first column value of input matrix
 	r2 -> temp variable for storing first row second column value of input matrix
 	r3 -> temp variable for storing first row second column value of input matrix
 	r4 -> calculating means of rows for columns with names of c_name for input matrix
 	comb -> combining r1,r2,r3 and r4

Create tidy dataset with means of the numeric columns
	dataset_tidy -> dataset with rowmeans of dataset2_split
